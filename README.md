# Tadah Eleven
Atrocious bullshit from August of 2021 that uses bad, ugly, and old August 2021 Tadah code with ***unfinished*** 2011 Roblox views. (Seriously, the register page isn't even functional).

***I AM NOT PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR THIS CODE!*** Good on you if you manage to repair it to a good-enough state. It's kind of ugly, though. Really ugly.
